### POWER OUTAGE
One of the biggest factors for my hardships was time (there is never really enough), but more specifically in the time aspect, I had trouble with scope of project and implementation. Outside of natural causes like losing power to storms, my largest issues happened during a power outage. Normally that doesnt break anything, but it happends during a git push for one. The push was interrupted during the power outage and it hung on and didnt push my informatin to github. At least not all of it. That error refactored a lot of my code and a lot was lost as well in the process. It tooka total of 16 hours to recover. Getting in contant with Git and having them walk me through a command line reversion process to try and roll back my code why they recovered what was lost. It turn out for the better but, I have learned that broken code can soometimes be the least of your task.
