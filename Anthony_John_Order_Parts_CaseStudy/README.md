# CURRENT WEAKPOINTS
> *NOTE*: JUnit Testing, need more practice with how to encapsulate you project with this and how to set it up better.

> *NOTE*: Using the HQL database query annotations. i.e. setting up an @ManytoMany relationship properly.

> *NOTE*: Exception Handling, need more hands-on practice with using try/catch cases.

> *NOTE*: Properly scoping my project ideas so I dont keep falling into feature creep.
